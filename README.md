This is a remake of the board game Splendor with a few changes using Unity.

## Notice
This is just a passion project and I am still only a beginner to Unity and the C# programming language, so the code in this project ~~**Will Definately Not Be Good Or Consistant.**~~ Scratch that. ***WILL BE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND COMPLETELY INCONSISTANT***, so please, feel free to make a pull requests. Just be warned that you are risking getting a migrane.
