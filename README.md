# MinerCardGame
This is a remake of the board game Splendor with a few changes using Unity.

## Notice
This is just a passion project and I am still only a beginner to Unity and the C# programming language, so the code in this project ~~**Will Definately Not Be Good Or Consistant.**~~ Scratch that. ***WILL BE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND COMPLETELY INCONSISTANT***, so please, feel free to make a pull requests. Just be warned that you are risking getting a **migrane**.

## How The Game Starts
The game starts by shuffling 4 decks of cards. These decks are the **Level 1-3 Properties** and **Royals** in **Splendor** which are respectively called **Level 1-3 Mines** and **Billionaires** in Miner. Each of the **Mine** decks are set down on the table and 4 cards are pulled off the top of each and set face up next to the cards.
